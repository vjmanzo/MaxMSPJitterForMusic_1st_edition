This was the first Max patch I ever completed from a long time ago. 
It took me forever to do, it looks terrible, but it sort of works (with errors)!!
It was made with Max version 4 which is now obsolete (that's why the extension on the file is .mxb). 
I've included it here just for laughs--don't ever let the patch cords in your projects look this chaotic!!!!!


Best,

V.J.
